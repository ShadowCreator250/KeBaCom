## short project desription
This is a website and database based system that should help a server and the bar/cuisine with quick and easy communication.
The server opens an order, the bar/cuisine processes it and the server delivers it to the right table. 
All orders of a table are calculated together and a bill is created automatically if the client wants to pay.
The option that different clients and their families are sitting on the same table will also be considered.

## the project is realised with
websites paired with JavaScript and Node.js with different npm packages(nedb, ...).
